/*
 * C99 says in 6.7.8p4:
 *
 *	All the expressions in an initializer for an object that has static
 *	storage duration shall be constant expressions or string literals.
 *
 * The term "constant expression" is defined in C99 6.6, where 6.6p9 allows
 * "constant expressions" in initializers to also be an "address constant".
 * Using these address constants, it is possible to reference an unnamed
 * object created by a compound literal (C99 6.5.2.5), using either an
 * explicit '&' or the implicit array-to-pointer conversion from C99 6.3.2.1.
 *
 * Before init.c 1.195 from 2021-04-17, lint failed with an assertion failure
 * in check_global_variable, called by check_global_symbols since these
 * temporary objects have neither storage class EXTERN nor STATIC.
