/*-
 * Tests for the token '\n', which ends a line.
 *
 * A newline ends an end-of-line comment that has been started with '//'.
 *
 * When a line ends with a backslash immediately followed by '\n', these two
 * characters are merged and continue the logical line.
 * TODO: only in macros?
 * TODO: in string literals as well?
 *
 * In other contexts, a newline is an ordinary space character.
