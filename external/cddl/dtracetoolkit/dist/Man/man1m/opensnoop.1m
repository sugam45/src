.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
tracks file opens.
As a process issues a file open, details such as UID, PID and pathname are
printed out.
The returned file descriptor is printed, a value of \-1 indicates an error.
This can be useful for troubleshooting to determine if appliacions are
attempting to open files that do not exist.
Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
