.Dt DTRUSS 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm dtruss
.Nd process syscall details. Uses DTrace
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl acdeflhLos
.Op Fl t Ar syscall
.Op Fl p Ar PID | Fl n Ar name | command
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
prints details on process system calls.
It is like a DTrace version of truss, and has been designed to be less
intrusive than truss.
.Pp
Of particular interest is the elapsed times and on cpu times, which can
identify both system calls that are slow to complete, and those which are
consuming CPU cycles.
.Pp
Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the dtrace_kernel
privilege can run this command.
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl a
print all details
.It Fl b Ar bufsize
dynamic variable buffer size.
Increase this if you notice dynamic variable drop errors.
The default is
.Ql "4m"
for 4\~megabytes per CPU.
.It Fl c
print system call counts
.It Fl d
print relative timestamps, us (microseconds)
.It Fl e
print elapsed times, us
.It Fl f
follow children as they are forked
.It Fl L
don't print pid/lwpid per line
.It Fl l
force printing of pid/lwpid per line
.It Fl n Ar name
examine processes with this name
.It Fl o
print on-cpu times, us
.It Fl p Ar PID
examine this PID
.It Fl s
print stack backtraces
.It Fl t Ar syscall
examine this syscall only
.El
.Bl -column "SYSCALL(args)"
.It Sy Field      Ta Sy Description
.It PID/LWPID     Ta Process ID\|/\|Lightweight Process ID
.It RELATIVE      Ta relative timestamps to the start of the thread, us
.It ELAPSD        Ta elapsed time for this system call, us
.It CPU           Ta on-cpu time for this system call, us
.It SYSCALL(args) Ta system call name, with arguments (some may be evaluated)
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
run and examine the
.Ql df -h
command
.Pp
.Dl Ic dtruss df -h
.Pp
examine PID 1871
.Pp
.Dl Ic dtruss -p 1871
.Pp
examine all processes called "tar"
.Pp
.Dl Ic dtruss -n tar
.Pp
run
.Ql test.sh
and follow children
.Pp
.Dl Ic dtruss -f test.sh
.Pp
run the
.Ql date
command and print elapsed and on cpu times,
.Pp
.Dl Ic dtruss -eo date
.Ss STABILITY
stable \(em needs the syscall provider.
.Ss DOCUMENTATION
See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs directory.
The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with verbose
descriptions explaining the output.
.Sh EXIT
dtruss will run forever until Ctrl\-C is hit, or if a command was
executed dtruss will finish when the command ends.
