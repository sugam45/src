Release Notes

Introduction
------------

BIND 9.16 is a stable branch of BIND. This document summarizes
significant changes since the last production release on that branch.
Please see the CHANGES file for a more detailed list of changes and bug
fixes.

Note on Version Numbering
-------------------------

As of BIND 9.13/9.14, BIND has adopted the "odd-unstable/even-stable"
release numbering convention. BIND 9.16 contains new features that were
added during the BIND 9.15 development process. Henceforth, the 9.16
branch will be limited to bug fixes, and new feature development will
proceed in the unstable 9.17 branch.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

To build on Unix-like systems, BIND requires support for POSIX.1c
threads (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995), the Advanced Sockets API for IPv6
(:rfc:`3542`), and standard atomic operations provided by the C
compiler.

The libuv asynchronous I/O library and the OpenSSL cryptography library
must be available for the target platform. A PKCS#11 provider can be
used instead of OpenSSL for Public Key cryptography (i.e., DNSSEC
signing and validation), but OpenSSL is still required for general
cryptography operations such as hashing and random number generation.

More information can be found in the ``PLATFORMS.md`` file that is
included in the source distribution of BIND 9. If your compiler and
system libraries provide the above features, BIND 9 should compile and
run. If that is not the case, the BIND development team will generally
accept patches that add support for systems that are still supported by
their respective vendors.

Download
--------

End of Life
