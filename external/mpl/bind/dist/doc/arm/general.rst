General DNS Reference Information
=================================

.. _ipv6addresses:

IPv6 Addresses (AAAA)
---------------------

IPv6 addresses are 128-bit identifiers, for interfaces and sets of
interfaces, which were introduced in the DNS to facilitate scalable
Internet routing. There are three types of addresses: *Unicast*, an
identifier for a single interface; *Anycast*, an identifier for a set of
interfaces; and *Multicast*, an identifier for a set of interfaces. Here
we describe the global Unicast address scheme. For more information, see
:rfc:`3587`, "IPv6 Global Unicast Address Format."

IPv6 unicast addresses consist of a *global routing prefix*, a *subnet
identifier*, and an *interface identifier*.

The global routing prefix is provided by the upstream provider or ISP,
and roughly corresponds to the IPv4 *network* section of the address
range. The subnet identifier is for local subnetting, much like
subnetting an IPv4 /16 network into /24 subnets. The interface
identifier is the address of an individual interface on a given network;
in IPv6, addresses belong to interfaces rather than to machines.

The subnetting capability of IPv6 is much more flexible than that of
IPv4; subnetting can be carried out on bit boundaries, in much the same
way as Classless InterDomain Routing (CIDR), and the DNS PTR
representation ("nibble" format) makes setting up reverse zones easier.

The interface identifier must be unique on the local link, and is
usually generated automatically by the IPv6 implementation, although it
is usually possible to override the default setting if necessary. A
typical IPv6 address might look like:
``2001:db8:201:9:a00:20ff:fe81:2b32``.

IPv6 address specifications often contain long strings of zeros, so the
architects have included a shorthand for specifying them. The double
colon (``::``) indicates the longest possible string of zeros that can
fit, and can be used only once in an address.

Requests for Comment (RFCs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BIND 9 strives for strict compliance with IETF standards. To the best
of our knowledge, BIND 9 complies with the following RFCs, with
the caveats and exceptions listed in the numbered notes below. Many
of these RFCs were written by current or former ISC staff members.
The list is non-exhaustive.

Specification documents for the Internet protocol suite, including the
DNS, are published as part of the Request for Comments (RFCs) series of
technical notes. The standards themselves are defined by the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Engineering Steering
Group (IESG). RFCs can be viewed online at: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/ .

Some of these RFCs, though DNS-related, are not concerned with implementing
software.

RFCs No Longer Supported in BIND 9
----------------------------------

:rfc:`2536` - D. Eastlake, 3rd. *DSA KEYs and SIGs in the Domain Name System
(DNS).* March 1999.

Notes
~~~~~

[1] Queries to zones that have failed to load return SERVFAIL rather
than a non-authoritative response. This is considered a feature.

[2] CLASS ANY queries are not supported. This is considered a
feature.

[3] When receiving a query signed with a SIG(0), the server is
only able to verify the signature if it has the key in its local
authoritative data; it cannot do recursion or validation to
retrieve unknown keys.

[4] Compliance is with loading and serving of A6 records only. A6 records were moved
to the experimental category by :rfc:`3363`.

[5] Minimally covering NSEC records are accepted but not generated.

[6] BIND 9 interoperates with correctly designed experiments.

[7] ``named`` only uses ports to extend the ID space; addresses are not
used.

[8] Section 5.5 does not match reality. ``named`` uses the presence
of DO=1 to detect if validation may be occurring. CD has no bearing
on whether validation occurs.

[9] Compliance is conditional on the OpenSSL library being linked against
a supporting ECDSA.

[10] RSAMD5 support has been removed. See :rfc:`6944`.

[11] Section 5.9 - Always set CD=1 on queries. This is *not* done, as
it prevents DNSSEC from working correctly through another recursive server.

When talking to a recursive server, the best algorithm is to send
CD=0 and then send CD=1 iff SERVFAIL is returned, in case the recursive
server has a bad clock and/or bad trust anchor. Alternatively, one
can send CD=1 then CD=0 on validation failure, in case the recursive
server is under attack or there is stale/bogus authoritative data.

[12] Updating of parent zones is not yet implemented.

[13] ``named`` does not currently encrypt DNS requests, so the PAD option
is accepted but not returned in responses.

[14] Section 4 is ignored.

[15] This does not apply to DNS server implementations.

[16] Only the Base 64 encoding specification is supported.

[17] Wildcard records are not supported in DNSSEC secure zones.

[18] Servers authoritative for secure zones being resolved by BIND
9 must support EDNS0 (RFC2671), and must return all relevant SIGs
and NXTs in responses, rather than relying on the resolving server
to perform separate queries for missing SIGs and NXTs.

[19] BIND 9 requires ``--with-idn`` to enable entry of IDN labels within dig,
host, and nslookup at compile time.  ACE labels are supported
everywhere with or without ``--with-idn``.

[20] Section 5.1 - DNAME records are fully supported.

.. _internet_drafts:

Internet Drafts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Internet Drafts (IDs) are rough-draft working documents of the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF). They are, in essence, RFCs in the preliminary
stages of development. Implementors are cautioned not to regard IDs as
archival, and they should not be quoted or cited in any formal documents
unless accompanied by the disclaimer that they are "works in progress."
IDs have a lifespan of six months, after which they are deleted unless
updated by their authors.
