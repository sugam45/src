message not_enough_entropy
{This system seems to lack a cryptographically strong pseudo random
number generator. There is not enough entropy available to create secure
keys (e.g. ssh host keys). 

You may use random data generated on another computer and load it
here, or you could enter random characters manually. 
 
If you own a USB random number device, connect it now and select
the "Re-test" option.}

message entropy_add_manually		{Manual input of random data}
message entropy_download_raw		{Load random data}
message	entropy_download_seed		{Import a NetBSD entropy file}
message entropy_retry			{Re-test}

message entropy_enter_manual1
{Enter random characters.}

message entropy_enter_manual2
{They should contain at last 256 bits of randomness, as in 256 coin
tosses, 100 throws of a 6-sided die, 64 random hexadecimal digits, or
(if you are able to copy & paste output from another machine into this
installer) the output from running the following command on another
machine whose randomness you trust:}

message entropy_enter_manual3
{Do not use the same data for multiple installations. 
Terminate the input with an empty line.}

message entropy_manual_not_enough
{You did not enter enough characters!}

message entropy_select_file
{Please select how you want to transfer the random data file
to this machine:}

message entropy_add_download_ftp
{Download via ftp}

message entropy_add_download_http
{Download via http}

message download_entropy
{Start download}

message entropy_add_nfs
{Load from a NFS share}

message entropy_add_local
{Load from a local file system (e.g. a USB device)}

message entropy_file
{Path/file}

message load_entropy
{Load random data}

message set_entropy_file
{Random data file path}

/* Called with:				Example
 *  $0 = content of file		NetBSD entropy seed file

{Select a server, a share and the file path to load the $0.}

/* Called with:				Example

message entropy_via_download
{Since not enough entropy is available on this system, all crytographic
operations are suspect to replay attacks. 
Please only use trustworthy local networks.}

{random data binary file}

{On a system with cryptographically strong pseudo random number generator
you can create a file with random binary data like this:}

{NetBSD entropy seed file}

message entropy_seed_hdr
{On a NetBSD system with cryptographically strong pseudo random number
generator you can create an entropy snapshot like this:}

message entropy_path_and_file
{Path and filename}

message entropy_localfs
{Enter the unmounted local device and directory on that device where
the random data is located.}
