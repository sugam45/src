.Sh NAME
.Nm isapnp
.Nd introduction to ISA Plug-and-Play support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "isapnp0 at isa?"
.Pp
An
.Nm
bus can be configured for each supported ISA bus.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nx
provides machine-independent bus support and
drivers for ISA Plug-and-Play (isapnp) autoconfiguration of
PnP-compatible
devices on an ISA bus.
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES
.Nx
includes machine-independent ISAPNP drivers, sorted by function
and driver name:
.Ss SCSI interfaces
.Bl -tag -width pcdisplay -offset indent
.It Xr aha 4
Adaptec AHA-154[02]
.Tn SCSI
interfaces.
.It Xr aic 4

.Tn SCSI
interfaces.
.El
.Ss Disk controllers
.Bl -tag -width pcdisplay -offset indent
.It Xr wdc 4

.El
.Pp
ISA Plug-and-Play devices also have alternate ISA drivers with
static ISA IO address configuration.
These are listed in
.Xr isa 4 .
The
.Nm
bus ignores devices that have already been found and configured as
.Xr isa 4
devices.
The
.Nm
bus is only effective on machines which lack a PnP BIOS, or  on
which the PnP BIOS has been disabled.
The manual pages for each individual
.Nm
driver also list
the supported front-ends for other buses.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
appeared in
.Nx 1.3 .
