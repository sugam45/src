.Sh DESCRIPTION
The functions documented here are general routines for internal use in
file systems to implement common policies for performing various operations.
The developer must understand that these routines implement no system-wide
policies and only take into account the object being accessed and the
nominal values of the credentials accessing it.
.Pp
In other words, these functions are not meant to be called directly.
They are intended to be used in
.Xr kauth 9
vnode scope authorization calls, for providing the fall-back file system
decision.
.Pp
As a rule of thumb, code that looks like this is wrong:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
error = genfs_can_foo(...); /* WRONG */
.Ed
.Pp
While code that looks like this is right:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
error = kauth_authorize_vnode(..., genfs_can_foo(...));
